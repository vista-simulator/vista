`VISTA <https://vista.csail.mit.edu>`_ is a data-driven simulation engine for autonomous driving perception and control. The VISTA API provides an interface for transforming real-world datasets into virtual environments with dynamic agents, sensor suites, and task objectives.

All code is available on our `github repository <https://github.com/vista-simulator/vista>`_.


Installation
++++++++++++
VISTA can be installed into your Python 3 environment using the `PyPi package interface <https://pypi.org/project/vista/>`_.

::

    >> pip install vista

Please also ensure that you have all required dependencies to successfully run VISTA. Details on dependencies are outlined in :ref:`getting_started-installation`.

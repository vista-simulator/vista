VISTA is a data-driven simulator that can generally interface with *existing datasets* to build virtual worlds for autonomous training and testing. To ensure compatibility with VISTA, datasets must be represented in a certain format. In this section, we provide a series of scripts to perform a conversion of several popular open-source datasets into a VISTA-compatible format.

Custom External Data
++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::
  These conversion scripts from open-source data serve as concrete examples for importing external datasets into VISTA. In order to integrate your own datasets into VISTA, these conversion scripts can be easily modified to fit your specific data format.

  More details and instruction for this conversion coming soon!
